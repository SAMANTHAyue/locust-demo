# locust-demo
Locust is an easy-to-use, distributed, user load testing tool. It is intended for load-testing web sites (or other systems) and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle.<br></br>
This project is to describe how to do load testing on a simple Flask app using GKE and Locust.
